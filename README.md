My name is Jose (aka. vectorNull) and I'm a Web Developer and Security Researcher.  I am a graduate of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program but have been around the tech world for many years. I have my CompTIA Security+ and am working on eLearnSecurity's WPT certification. Here's a short list of my skills:

* Web Application Security / OWASP Top 10
* Virtualization / Containers (Docker - Vagrant)
* Vanilla Javascript
* Python / Django
* APIs (I'm actually somewhat obsessed with these)
* Node.js (Love the backend stuff!!) 
* Mongo/Express/React/Node (MERN)
* JamStack
* Love CTFs on hackthebox.eu
